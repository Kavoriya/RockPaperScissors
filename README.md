# RockPaperScissors

In this project I am making the game Rock, Paper, Scissors.

04.12.22 
I made the game which works in console.
I learned how to use functions, and an array.

15.12.22

I added UI, which allows the player to play 5 rounds by choosing a shape using buttons.
UI shows which rounds were wins, losses or draws.
After 5 round the game shows who won and offers to play again.
